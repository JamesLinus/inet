====== inet-4.x ======

2017-09-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	All: Merged InterfaceEntry and corresponding NIC module.

	  - InterfaceEntry->getName() replaced to
	InterfaceEntry->getInterfaceName()

2017-09-12  Levente Mészáros

	All: Added alias for std::make_shared, std::dynamic_pointer_cast, etc. to
	support replacing the implementation.

	The reason to allow replacing the standard shared pointer is that it uses
	synchronization primitives to achieve thread safety. Thread safety is not
	required for INET simulations.

2017-09-11  Levente Mészáros

	All: Renamed byte -> B and bit -> b according to IEC & IEEE unit
	conventions.

2017-07-14  Levente Mészáros

	All: Renamed arguments in handleLowerPacket and handleUpperPacket to
	packet.

2017-07-14  Levente Mészáros

	All: Replaced cPacket with Packet in LayeredProtocolBase and subclasses.

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Added linkBreak statistic.

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	All: Renamed NF_LINK_BREAK signal to linkBreak(Signal).

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Added missing packet drop related statistics.

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Added missing packetDrop signal emitting code.

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Added limit to packetDrop signals with queueOverflow reason.

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Added limit to packetDrop signals with retryLimitReached reason.

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	All: Renamed NF_PACKET_DROP to packetDrop(Signal).

2017-07-10  Levente Mészáros

	All: Added reason codes where packet drop signals are emitted.

2017-07-12  Levente Mészáros

	All: Replaced packetFromLowerDropped and packetFromUpperDropped with
	NF_PACKET_DROP signal.

2017-07-10  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Fixed @signal[NF_LINK_BREAK] emitted object types.

2017-03-07  Levente Mészáros

	All: Renamed a bunch of variables around popHeader and peekHeader.

2017-02-16  Levente Mészáros

	All: Renamed a bunch of variables around popHeader and peekHeader.

2017-03-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	TODO CSMA: Added temporary kludges to pass fingerprint tests.

2017-03-07  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Changed to use bit/byte where appropriate.

	Some mac protocols were wrong due to the previous Packet implementation
	not supporting bit precise lengths.

2017-01-19  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Renamed MACFrameBase to MacHeaderBase.

2017-01-19  Levente Mészáros

	CSMA: Renamed CSMAFrame to CSMAHeader.

2017-01-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	CSMA: Changed to use the new Packet class.

2016-10-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	refactoring: removed compatibility macros required for OMNeT++ 4.x builds
	+ warning fixes

2016-06-30  Florian Kauer

	Send multicasts as link-layer broadcasts for CSMA

	Previously multicasts were dropped in the CSMA layer. However, several
	algorithms, especially GPSR use multicasts. Since association is not
	implemented anyway for IEEE 802.15.4, there should be no difference in
	the handling of broadcasts and multicasts on the link layer.

2015-06-23  Levente Mészáros

	Link: Added network protocol to BMac, LMac, CSMA frames.

====== inet-3.x ======

2017-10-02  ------ inet-3.6.2 released ------

2017-09-29  Levente Mészáros

2016-05-11  Levente Meszaros

	CSMA: Fixed handling of frames with bit errors.

2016-05-19  Andras Varga

	https://github.com/GRCDEV/mixim-sommer/find/VACaMobil

2016-06-01  ------ inet-3.3.0 released ------

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-04-22  Rudolf Hornig

	Added NF_LINK_BREAK notification. This enables ad-hoc routing protocols to
	work correctly with this MAC.

2015-04-22 Rudolf Hornig

	Added support for sending NF_LINK_BREAK signal. This is required for certain
	routing protocols (i.e. AODV) to function properly.

2015-02-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	Replaced getParentModule calls with module parameters.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe
