	All: Added alias for std::make_shared, std::dynamic_pointer_cast, etc. to
	support replacing the implementation.

	The reason to allow replacing the standard shared pointer is that it uses
	synchronization primitives to achieve thread safety. Thread safety is not
	required for INET simulations.

	All: Renamed byte -> B and bit -> b according to IEC & IEEE unit
	conventions.
